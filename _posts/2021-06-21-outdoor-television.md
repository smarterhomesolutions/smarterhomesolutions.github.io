I have recently bought a hot tub to enjoy the starry nights and to watch the sun go down.  Whilst we wait for delivery (6 months!), I've been contemplating exactly where to put it in the garden.  

My wife suggested we could put the hot tub in front of the french doors at the rear of our home, which when opened we could watch a TV attached to the back wall of our dining room.

Then I discovered you can buy an outdoor television, I did not know that was even a thing!  And they're not small too and unlike a living room where you can't go too big, you are outdoors so bigger is most definitely better!

On further investigation, I've found that Amazon actually supply these products!

These are going on my wish list!
