Remember the film with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks "You've got mail", well today with the help of [IJPUK.COM](https://www.ijpuk.com/solutions/read/amazon-alexa-doorbell-skill) and their Alexa doorbell skill service whenever the postman delivers the mail, Alexa announces "You've got mail".

## How?

With the help of a battery-operated door / window sensor stuck to the letterbox and coupled with a home automation controller, which sends a notification to [IJPUK.COM](https://www.ijpuk.com/solutions/read/amazon-alexa-doorbell-skill), which runs an Alexa routine to make an announcement all around the house which says "You've got mail!"

Easy!
