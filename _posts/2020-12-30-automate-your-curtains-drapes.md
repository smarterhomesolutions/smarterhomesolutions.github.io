Just before Christmas, I installed two of these robotic curtain opener/closer devices (drapes to our American friends) in less than 30 minutes.  I chose the rod version (track is also available) as our curtains have eyelets and because the curtains open from the middle, I needed two. Ours are configured to work as a pair, so one command and they open/close.

I also ordered the [hub](https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-hub-mini?sca_ref=533876.jGUgXLNUZy) to enable control via Cloud services like [IFTTT.com](https://www.ifttt.com) and the Amazon Alexa.
Using [IJPUK.com Alexa Doorbell skill](https://www.ijpuk.com/solutions/read/amazon-alexa-doorbell-skill) I can now control the automatic opening and closing of the curtains from my home automation system via their simple API.

That's one more thing I don't have to think about!  Thank you [Switchbot!](https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-curtain?sca_ref=533876.jGUgXLNUZy)
